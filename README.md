## Clustering task

I investigated whether red wines can be clustered according to their physiochemical properties. This could help with ‘profiling’ wines by using just one or two physiochemical measures to predict other physiochemical properties, saving time and resources.

I chose a dataset of wines from the north of Portugal (Cortez, 2009). I accessed this dataset from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). The dataset contains 12 features and 1,599 instances of red wines.
